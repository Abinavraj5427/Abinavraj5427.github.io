                        I created this website for a nonprofit. Children can submit their medical stories
                        along with some artwork to inspire and share their voices to others.

                        For this architecture, I used Google App Scripts, Google Sheets, Firebase, and HTML/CSS/JS. 
                        This was useful because we could control all data from the Google sheets rather than the code.

                        <h4><strong>It had over 600 users, and 2600 page views</strong></h4>
