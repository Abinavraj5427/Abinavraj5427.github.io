                    <p>Negotiating your tech compensation can be a tricky process as there&#39;s a lot outside of the base salary that forms your total compensation package. There&#39;s often stress and confusion when trying to understand the compensation. </p>
                    <p>That&#39;s why we created Chromera, a fin-tech web app that helps you understand your compensation, projected growth, and after-tax salary in an instant! </p>
                    <h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
                    <p>Chromera is a web application that allows tech professionals to easily analyze and understand how their total compensation statement is broken down by using a variety of different visuals.  Tech compensation is made up of base salary, a target bonus, stock grants (over 4 years), and sign-on bonuses (in addition to relocation assistance and other perks).  By entering data into the various fields, the user can easily calculate and visualize their compensation. Once they&#39;re done, they can share their unique URL with their friends and family, and compare the results! </p>
                    <h2 id="how-we-built-it">How we built it</h2>
                    <p>We used React.js for the front end, and Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for the back end.</p>
