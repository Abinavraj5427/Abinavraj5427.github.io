                    <p>
                        I did this project in preparation of Dr. Yuke Zhu's Robotic Perception Lab. The goal of this lab is to 
                        look at various RL structures and identify how to improve them for temporal environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>In this research, I have messed around with robosuite, an environment library for python and Mujoco an OpenGL
                    rendering library. I used these environments to test graphical robots with machine learning models
                    to simulate object grasping. To do this, I used stable-baselines, python, tensorflow, pytorch, and many other libraries.
