                I am currently an 18 year old senior at Tompkins High School.
                I will be majoring in computer science and have several work
                experiences. I have been working on projects for 4.5 years, and have
                accomplished many feats in:

                Computer science is my life. I work on it everyday or think about it everyday.
                I am a very reliable and professional person in this industry.

                Additionally, I also love teaching other people computer science. I spend hours
                on professional documentation for my code. I like making all my projects
                sustainable for years with a good user interface.
