        I am currently an 18 year old senior at Tompkins High School.
        I will be majoring in computer science and have several work
        experiences. I have been working on projects for 4.5 years, and have
        accomplished many feats in:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Robotics</li>
        <li>Website Development</li>
        <li>Mobile App Development</li>
        <li>Software Development</li>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
        </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Computer science is my life. I work on it everyday or think about it everyday.
        I am a very reliable and professional person in this industry.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, I also love teaching other people computer science. I spend hours
        on professional documentation for my code. I like making all my projects
        sustainable for years with a good user interface.
